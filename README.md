# Sneaker Resell Simulator

## Usage

Main Script:
```lua
_G.AltAccountController = 0 -- UserId of your main account to control alt accounts
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zionqyl/Sneaker/main/Latest.lua"))()
```
Sniper:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zionqyl/Sneaker/main/Sniper.lua"))()
```
Recommended is to execute the main script when at main game and then the rest is loaded upon game teleportation.
Minimal setup required; execute script once with a compatible executor and that's it!

## Compatible executors

Only tested it with Wave, please let me know if the script works with other executors aswell

## Commands

This is how the structure looks like; `/e` `[command]` `[arguments]`
Currently only chat commands are stable and working!
